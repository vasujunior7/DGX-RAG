2025-08-09 23:26:41,422 - app - INFO - Answer for question 2: The Transformer architecture consists of stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. The encoder is composed of a stack of 6 identical layers, each with two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The output of each sub-layer is passed through a residual connection and layer normalization. The Transformer model relies entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution....
