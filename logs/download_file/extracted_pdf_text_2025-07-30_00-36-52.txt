WARNING
!

Take time to learn & practice your 
vehicle
Your vehicle can provide many years of 
service and pleasure if you take responsibility 
for your own safety and understand the 
challenges you can meet on the road.
It is a proven fact, helmet significantly reduces 
the number and severity of head injuries. So 
always wear a helmet and make sure your 
pillion rider does the same. We also 
recommend that you wear eye protection, 
sturdy boots, gloves and other protective gear.
Before riding your vehicle
Make sure that you are physically fit, mentally 
focused and free of alcohol and drugs. Check 
that you and your pillion are both wearing an 
approved vehicle helmet and protective 
apparel. Instruct your pillion on holding onto 
the grab rail or your waist, leaning with you in 
turns, and keeping their feet on the footrest, 
even when the vehicle is stopped.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
There is much that you can do to protect 
yourself when you ride. You will find many 
helpful recommendations through out this 
manual. Following are a few that we consider 
most important.
Always wear a helmet
Even if you have ridden other vehicles, 
practice riding in a safe area to become 
familiar with how this vehicle works and 
handles, and to become accustomed to the 
vehicle's size and weight.
VEHICLE SAFETY
Always pay due attention to other vehicles 
around you, and do not assume that other 
drivers see you. Be prepared to stop quickly or 
perform an evasive maneuver.
Some drivers do not see vehicles because they 
are not looking for them. To make yourself more 
visible, wear bright reflective clothing, position 
yourself so that others can see you, signal before 
turning or changing lanes, and use horn which 
will help others to notice you.
Do not drink and ride
Ride defensively
Make yourself easily visible
Ride within your limits
Pushing the limits is another major cause of 
vehicle accidents. Never ride beyond your 
personal abilities or faster than conditions 
demand. Remember that fatigue and 
negligence can significantly reduce your ability 
to make good judgements and ride safely.
Riding under the influence of alcohol or drugs 
is dangerous. Alcohol can reduce your ability 
to respond to changing conditions and reduce 
the reaction time. Do not drink and ride. 
Keep your vehicle in safe condition
For safe riding, its important to inspect your 
vehicle before every ride and perform all 
recommended maintenance. Never exceed 
load limits, and use accessories that have been 
recommended by Hero MotoCorp for this 
vehicle. 
8
Your helmet is your most important piece of 
riding gear because it offers the best 
protection against head injuries. A helmet 
should fit your head comfortably and securely. 
A bright coloured helmet can make you more 
noticeable in traffic, as can reflective strips.
In addition to a helmet and eye protection, we 
also recommend:
• Leather gloves to keep your hands warm 
and help prevent blisters, cuts, burns, and 
bruises.
An open-face helmet offers some protection, 
but a full-face helmet offers more. Always 
wear face shield or goggles to protect your 
eyes and help your vision.
Additional riding gear
Helmets and eye protection
• Sturdy boots with non-slip soles to help 
protect your feet and ankles.
• A two wheeler riding suit or jacket for 
comfort as well as protection. Bright 
coloured reflective clothing can help make 
you more noticeable in traffic. Be sure to 
avoid loose clothes that could get caught on 
any part of your vehicle. 
PROTECTIVEAPPAREL
 
Following are suggestions to help you choose 
proper riding  gear. 
Personal safety is your first priority. If you or 
anyone else has been injured, take time to 
assess the severity of the injuries and whether 
it is safe to continue riding. Call for emergency 
assistance if needed. Also follow applicable 
laws and regulations if another person or 
vehicle is involved in the crash.
If you decide to continue riding, first evaluate 
the condition of your vehicle. If the engine is 
still running, turn it off. Inspect for fluid leaks, 
check the tightness of critical nuts and bolts, 
and check the handlebar, brake levers, brakes, 
and wheels. Ride slowly and cautiously. Your 
vehicle may have suffered damage that is not 
immediately apparent. Have your vehicle 
thoroughly checked at a qualified service 
facility as soon as possible.
If you are involved in a crash
For your safety, we strongly recommend that 
you always wear an approved helmet (ISI 
marked), eye protection, boots, gloves, long 
pants and a long sleeve shirt or jacket 
whenever you ride. Take care of loose/ 
hanging clothes while solo/pillion riding. 
Although complete protection is not possible, 
wearing proper gear can reduce the chance of 
injury when you ride. 
• Not wearing a helmet increases the chance of 
serious injury or death in a crash. 
• Be sure you and your pillion always wear a 
helmet, eye protection and other protective 
apparel when you ride.
WARNING
!

• To make yourself more visible, wear bright 
reflective clothing that fits well.
• Always conduct simple pre-ride inspection 
(page 28).
• Respect road signs and obey traffic rules for 
your own safety and that of others on the 
road (page 71).
• Always wear a helmet (ISI marked) with 
chin strap securely fastened and insist on a 
helmet for your pillion rider.
• Give way to others on the road and signal 
before you make a turn.
• To stop the vehicle (in IBS), press the rear 
brake pedal for the application of front and 
rear brakes simultaneously. However, for 
more effective braking, use both brakes 
simultaneously, keeping throttle in the 
closed position.
• Before riding make sure in which mode you 
are riding whether with i3s switch “ON” or 
“OFF”.
• Ride defensively and at a steady speed 
(between 40-50 km/hr).
• While riding, sit in a comfortable position 
with your legs close to fuel tank.
• During night time, dip headlamps of your 
vehicle for oncoming traffic, or when 
following another vehicle.
• Tightly wrap loose/hanging clothes & avoid 
entangling with moving parts.
Do's:
• Get your vehicle serviced regularly by the 
Authorised Hero MotoCorp workshop.
Don't
• Never use cell phone while riding the      
vehicle.
• Avoid sudden acceleration, braking and 
turning of your  vehicle.
• Never ride under the influence of alcohol or 
drugs.
• Do not litter the road.
• Never shift gears without disengaging the 
clutch and closing the throttle.
• Do not cross the continuous white/yellow 
line in the center of the road, while 
overtaking.
• Never touch any part of the hot exhaust      
system like muffler.
• Do not attach large or heavy items to the      
handlebars, front forks, or fenders.
• Never take your hands off the steering 
handle while riding.
• Do not move the side stand down while 
riding, as engine will stop while vehicle is in 
gear (page 23) (Wheel locking leading to 
accident, part damage etc.).
• Concentrate on the road and avoid talking 
to the pillion rider or others on the road.
SAFE RIDING TIPS
10
11
The following tips shall ensure a healthy vehicle, healthy environment, and a healthy you.
• Emission pollution: Get emission of your vehicle checked by Authorised agencies atleast 
once every 3 months or as notified by the government from time to time.
• Genuine engine oil: Hero 4T Plus SAE 10W 30 SL grade (JASO MA2) engine oil 
recommended by Hero MotoCorp and make sure you change it every 6000 km. (with 
top up every 3000 kilometres) to keep the engine fit and environment healthy.
• Healthy engine: The engine is the lifeline of every vehicle. To keep it healthy, it should be 
tuned regularly, which will also help reduce pollution and improve vehicle performance & 
fuel efficiency.
• Genuine spares: Always insist on Hero MotoCorp genuine parts as spurious or 
incompatible spares and accessories can upset or deteriorate your vehicle’s running 
condition.
• Noise pollution : Noise beyond a certain decibel is pollution. Whether it is from horns or 
defective mufflers, excessive noise will cause headaches and discomfort.
• Fuel saving & Reduce pollution : Switch "OFF" the engine while waiting at traffic signal 
points to save fuel and reduce pollution, if the waiting period is long.
• BS-VI grade fuel : Always use BS-VI grade fuel to adhere BS-VI norms. 
• Regular servicing: Get your vehicle serviced at an Authorised Hero MotoCorp 
workshop, as per the service schedule, for an optimum performance and keep the emission 
level under check.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Carbon monoxide poisoning from 
engine exhaust.
• Make sure the engine is “OFF” before you 
begin any maintenance or repair. This will 
help to eliminate several potential hazards:
  Be sure there is adequate ventilation 
whenever you operate the engine.
• Burns from hot parts.
  Let the engine and exhaust system cool 
before touching.
• Injury from moving parts.
• Read the instruction before you begin and 
make sure you have the tools and skills 
required.
      Do not run the engine unless instructed 
to do so.
• To reduce the possibility of a fire or 
explosion, be careful when working around 
petrol or batteries. Use only nonflammable 
solvent, not petrol, to clean parts. Keep 
cigarettes, sparks and flames away from the 
battery and all fuel-related parts.
• To help prevent the vehicle from falling 
over, park it on a firm, level surface on the 
main stand.
To ensure best quality and reliability, it is 
recommended to use Hero MotoCorp 
genuine parts for repair and replacement.
Remember that your Authorised Hero 
MotoCorp workshop knows your vehicle best 
and is fully equipped to maintain and repair it.

Recommended spark plugs: 
For most riding conditions this spark plug heat 
range number is satisfactory. However, if the 
vehicle is going to be operated for extended 
periods at high speeds or near maximum 
power in hot climates, the spark plug should 
be changed to a cold heat range number,

SPARK PLUG INSPECTION
• Clean any dirt around the spark plug base.
• Make sure that the spark plug gap is   
0.8-0.9 mm using a wire-type feeler 
gauge. If adjustment is necessary, bend the 
side electrode carefully. Make sure the plug 
washer is in good conditions.
• Tighten a new spark plug 1/2 turn with 
spark plug wrench to compress the washer. 
If you are reusing a plug, it should only take 
1/8-1/4 turn after the plug seats. 
• With the plug washer attached, thread the 
spark plug in by hand to prevent cross-
threading.
(1) Noise suppressor cap       (2) Spark plug
0.8-0.9 mm 
• Visually inspect the spark plug electrodes for 
wear. The center electrode should have 
square edges and the side electrode should 
not be eroded. Discard the spark plug if 
there is apparent wear or if the insulator is 
cracked or chipped.
• Do not remove the spark plug and test for  
spark on the vehicle by cranking the engine 
as this could lead to fire or explosion
• Install a dummy spark plug in the cylinder 
head and test for spark.

The drive chain (1) should be checked and 
lubricated as part of the pre-ride inspection 
(page 28). Under severe usage, or when the 
vehicle is ridden in unusually dusty areas.
DRIVE CHAIN SLACKNESS
The service life of the drive chain depends 
upon proper lubrication and adjustment.
more frequent maintenance will be necessary.
• Turn the engine “OFF”, park the vehicle on 
its main stand and shift the transmission to 
neutral. Remove hole cap (2).
• Drive chain slack (3) should be adjusted to 
allow approximately 30 mm vertical 
movement by hand.

• Turn the chain to view chain lock plate (4) 
inside the hole. Ensure that the chain lock 
plate open end (5) is installed in the 
opposite direction of the chain rotation.
• Inspect the sprocket teeth for wear or 
damage.
If the chain is slack in one section and tight in 
another, some links are kinked and binding. 
Binding can be eliminated by frequent 
lubrication.
49
• If the drive chain or sprockets are 
excessively worn or damaged, they should 
be replaced. Never use a new chain with 
worn out sprockets since this will result in 
rapid chain wear.

The tyres fitted on your vehicle are of 
TUBELESS type.
TUBELESS TYRES
To safely operate your vehicle, your tyres must 
be of the proper type and size, in good 
condition with adequate tread, and correctly 
inflated for the load you are carrying.
The following pages give more detailed 
information on how and when to check the air 
pressure, how to inspect your tyres for 
damage, and what to do when your tyres need 
to be repaired or replaced. 
Generally, under-inflated tyres wear unevenly, 
adversely affect handling and are more likely 
to fail from being overheated.
Keeping your tyres properly inflated provides 
the best combination of handling, tread life 
and riding comfort.
Air pressure
Under inflated tyres can also cause wheel 
damage in rocky terrain.

Over-inflated tyres make your vehicle ride 
harshly, are more prone to damage from road 
hazards, and wear unevenly.
We recommend that you visually check your 
tyres before every ride and use a air pressure 
gauge (1) to measure air pressure at least 
once a month or any time you think the tyres 
pressure might be low.

A tyre that is repaired either temporarily or 
permanently, will have lower speed and 
performance limits than a new tyre. After an 
emergency repair, always have the tyre 
inspected/replaced at our authorised dealer 
and replace the tyre if suggested. 
Unidirectional tyres
Whenever the tyre is removed and put back in 
case of puncture, ensure the arrow mark (2) 
on the tyre is in the same direction as that of 
forward rotation of wheel.
Tyre repair
Repairing a puncture or removing a wheel 
requires special tools and technical expertise. 
If a tyre is punctured or damaged, it is advised 
to visit nearest tyre manufacture, Hero 
MotoCorp authorised dealer/workshop or the 
tyre repair shop who has expertise in 
repairing methods of tubeless tyre. 
You should not exceed 70 km/hour for the 
1st 24 hours or 105 km/hour at any time 
thereafter. In addition, you may not be able to 
safely carry as much load as with a new tyre. 
If you decide to have a tyre replace be sure the 
wheel is balanced before you ride.
Tyre replacement
The tyres that were installed on your vehicle 
were designed to match the performance 
capabilities of your vehicle and provide the 
best combination of handling, braking, 
 
durability and comfort.

WARNING
!
• Operation with excessively worn tyres is 
hazardous and will adversely affect traction 
and handling.
• Always use the size and type of tyres 
recommended in this owner's manual.
• Under-inflation may result in the tyre 
slipping on or tyre coming off the rim.

WARNING
!
An improperly adjust headlamp may blind 
oncoming rider/driver or it may fail to light the 
road for a safe distance.
A defective catalytic converter contributes to 
air pollution and can impair your engine’s 
performance.
CATALYTIC CONVERTER
This vehicle is equipped with the catalytic 
converter (1) in the muffler to meet the 
emission norms.
The catalytic converter contains precious 
metals that serve as catalysts, promoting 
chemical reactions to convert the exhaust 
gasses without affecting the metals. The 
catalytic converter acts on HC, CO and NOx.
The catalytic converter must operate at a high 
temperature for the chemical reactions to take 
place. It can set on fire any combustible 
material that come near it. Park your vehicle 
away from high grasses, dry leaves, or other 
flammable material.
Follow these guidelines to protect your 
vehicle’s catalytic converter.
• Always use unleaded petrol. Even a small 
amount of leaded petrol can contaminate 
the catalyst metals, making the catalytic 
converter ineffective.
• Keep the engine in good running condition. 
A poorly running engine can cause the 
catalytic converter to overheat.
• If your engine is misfiring, backfiring, 
stalling, or otherwise not running properly, 
stop riding and turn “OFF” the engine. Have 
 
your vehicle serviced as soon aspossible.
 
HEADLAMP FOCUS ADJUSTMENT
Headlamp is factory preset. However in case 
of adjustment required, please follow the steps 
as given below:
• Headlamp adjustment is done by the 
headlamp adjusting bolt (1) located below

NOTE
Polishing or waxing is not applicable for 
models having matte paint.
After washing your vehicle, wax all painted 
surfaces (except matte painted surfaces) using 
a commercially available polish/quality liquid 
or paste wax to finish the job. Use only a non 
abrasive polish or wax made specifically for 
automobiles. Apply the polish or wax 
according to the instructions on the container.
POLISHING OF VEHICLE
EVAPORATIVE EMISSION CONTROL 
SYSTEM
This vehicle is equipped with an evaporative 
emission control system to meet emission 
standards. During warm weather, the petrol
vapours which contain HC evaporates easily 
into the atmosphere from the fuel tank, if the 
fuel system is unsealed or open. The 
evaporative emission control system is used to 
prevent petrol vapours from escaping into the 
atmosphere from fuel tank. The canister (1) 
collects the fuel vapour from the fuel tank and 
then the fuel vapour is drawn into the engine 
for re-burning to avoid pollution caused by the 
fuel vapour diffused into the air.
